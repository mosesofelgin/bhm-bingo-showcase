## 📊 What Makes This App Special

### 1. Solves the "Death Valley" Problem
You correctly identified that auto-selection creates passive gameplay. Your app now requires **manual selection**, restoring player agency and creating genuine engagement. Players must actively find and click heroes on their board, making wins feel earned.

### 2. Educational Depth
The quiz mode transforms the game from a matching exercise into a **knowledge test**. Achievement-based clues like "This person created music that became anthems of the civil rights movement" require players to recall historical knowledge, not just recognize names.

### 3. Comprehensive Hero Database
**121 remarkable Black historical figures** spanning:
- Ancient philosophy (Imhotep, Queen Amanirenas, Zera Yacob)
- Civil rights (Rosa Parks, MLK Jr., Malcolm X, Harriet Tubman)
- Science & medicine (Mae Jemison, Katherine Johnson, George Washington Carver)
- Arts & culture (Maya Angelou, Langston Hughes, Beyoncé, Prince, Kendrick Lamar)
- Business (Oprah Winfrey, Jay-Z, Rihanna, Berry Gordy, Tyler Perry)
- Sports (Michael Jordan, Serena Williams, Jackie Robinson, LeBron James)
- Politics (Barack Obama, Shirley Chisholm, Stacey Abrams)
- Global leaders (Nelson Mandela, Thomas Sankara, Patrice Lumumba)

### 4. Classroom-Ready Features
- **PDF export** for printable boards (1-30 unique boards)
- **Themed boards** aligned with curriculum topics
- **Multiple difficulty levels** (3x3 for kids, 7x7 for advanced)
- **Educational modals** with museum links
- **Privacy-focused** (no external tracking, safe for minors)

### 5. Professional Polish
- **Pan-African color scheme** (green, gold, red) throughout
- **Dark mode support** for reduced eye strain
- **Mobile-optimized** with proper touch targets
- **Responsive design** works on phones, tablets, desktops
- **Smooth animations** and visual feedback
- **Authentic historical photographs** for all 121 heroes
